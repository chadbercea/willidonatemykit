Algorithm:
Assign weights to each factor. For instance:
Gear Quality: 0.3
Ammo Quality: 0.2
Map Knowledge: 0.1
Trading Prowess: 0.1
For each factor, normalize scores to a range of 0-10. For instance:
Gear Quality: If basePrice > X, score = 10, else calculate based on price range.
Ammo Quality: If damage > Y, score = 10, else calculate based on damage range.
Multiply each factor's score by its weight, and sum up all weighted scores to get a final survivability score out of 10.
The actual values, such as X or Y above, can be determined based on data trends or set as per desired difficulty.

Finally, turn the value into a percentage
